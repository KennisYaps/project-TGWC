What was good:
- Your code is quite clean - components/classes/functions are small, variables are well named, you generally followed React design patterns (except for the folder structure conventions) I
- Your UI design is quite nice too.
- And good job creating a Express server application for this! Just as a suggestion though, given that this is a personal portfolio page, you can actually "CRUD" the content (e.g. events, timelines, etc) just hardcoding the seed data in this project. If you need to add a new project, just update the seed data and commit and push. This would give you more time on enhancing the features and the UI on the front end.
- Otherwise, really nice work!  Keep it up

What could be improved:
