    Title: "Writing Code Without Planning",
    text:
      "Programming is mostly about reading previous code, researching what is needed and how it fits within the current system, and planning the writing of features with small, testable increments. The actual writing of lines of code is probably only 10% of the whole process.Do not think about programming as writing lines of code. Programming is a logic-based creativity that needs nurturing."

    Title: "Planning Too Much Before Writing Code",
    text:
      "Do not look for a perfect plan. That does not exist in the world of programming. Look for a good-enough plan, something that you can use to get started. The truth is, your plan will change, but what it was good for is to force you into some structure that leads to more clarity in your code. Too much planning is simply a waste of your time."

    Title: "Underestimating the Importance of Code Quality",
    text:
      "If you can only focus on one aspect of the code that you write, it should be its readability. Unclear code is trash. It is not even recyclable.Never underestimate the importance of code quality. Look at coding as a way to communicate implementations. Your main job as a coder is to clearly communicate the implementations of any solutions that you are working on."

    Title: "Not Quitting",
    text:
      "Another mistake that I have made more often than I cared to admit is sticking with the first solution even after I identify that it might not be the simplest approach. This is probably psychologically related to the “not-quitting” mentality. This is a good mentality to have in most activities, but it should not apply to programming. In fact, when it comes to writing programs, the right mentality is fail early and fail often.The minute you begin doubting a solution, you should consider throwing it away and re-thinking the problem. This is true no matter how much you were invested in that solution. Source control tools like GIT can help you branch off and experiment with many different solutions. Leverage that."
